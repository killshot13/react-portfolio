                <p>I empower my customers, clients, and the companies I work for to establish and secure their online interests. From web design to cloud encryption, "My Business Is You!"</p>

                <br></br>

                <p>I chose to study at Ironhack because it was the most challenging environment available to sharpen my skills. This is what sets me apart from the typical college IT graduate.</p>

                <br></br>

                <p>I desire a company culture that is driven, innovative, and respectable, and this matters more to me than the salary. I look forward to speaking with you soon!</p>
